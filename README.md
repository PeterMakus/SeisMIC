SeisMIC
=======

SeisMIC (**Seismological Monitoring with Interferometric Concepts**) is a software that emerged from the miic library. **SeisMIC** provides functionality to apply some concepts of seismic interferometry to different data of elastic waves. Its main use case is the monitoring of temporal changes in a mediums Green's Function (i.e., monitoring of temporal velocity changes).
