    Filter Fourier-transformed data

    Filter Fourier tranformed data by tapering in frequency domain. The `args`
    dictionary is supposed to contain the key `flimit` with a value that is a
    four element list or tuple defines the corner frequencies (f1, f2, f3, f4)
    in Hz of the cosine taper which is one between f2 and f3 and tapers to zero
    for f1 < f < f2 and f3 < f < f4.

    Sign bit normalization of frequency transformed data

    Divides each sample by its amplitude resulting in trace with amplidues of
    (-1, 0, 1). As this operation is done in frequency domain it requires two
    Fourier transforms and is thus quite costly but alows to be performed
    after other steps of frequency domain procesing e.g. whitening.

    Spectal whitening of Fourier-transformed date

    Normalize the amplitude spectrum of the complex spectra in `B`. The

    True the normalization of sets of three traces are normalized jointly by
    the mean of their amplitude spectra. This is useful for later rotation of
    correlated traces in the ZNE system into the ZRT system.
